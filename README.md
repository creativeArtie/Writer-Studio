# Writer Studios

## About
Writer Studios a word processor with note taking and goal setting abilities. It is
focused for authors to write fiction and non-fiction alike.  Notes can be put
into to the file anywhere yet allow easy to navigate to them. The goal settings
can be adjust as the document written.

Even though the mark-up language is made for this program, is very forgiving and
will highlight the syntax. In the future, there will be more support and will
have a [WYSIWYG mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG). This make learning
the language as just a faster way to format and insert notes and agendas.

This project is currently in alpha version, and will be optimized and will have
more features. The most up-to-date stable version is located 
[here](https://github.com/creativeArtie/Writer-Studios/releases/latest).

Currently, Writer Studio can produce a PDF file that meet the manuscript format
requirements (according to [here](https://www.scribophile.com/academy/how-to-format-a-novel-manuscript))
as seen with this [PDF file example](doc/example.pdf).

## Features
