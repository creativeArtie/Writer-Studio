     A fully observable implementation of a <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/FutureTask.html?is-external=true" title="class or interface in java.util.concurrent"><code>FutureTask</code></a>. <code>Task</code> exposes
     additional state and observable properties useful for programming asynchronous
     tasks in JavaFX, as defined in the <a href="../../javafx/concurrent/Worker.html" title="interface in javafx.concurrent"><code>Worker</code></a> interface. An implementation
     of Task must override the <a href="../../javafx/concurrent/Task.html#call--"><code>call()</code></a> method. This method
     is invoked on the background thread. Any state which is used in this method
     must be safe to read and write from a background thread. For example, manipulating
     a live scene graph from this method is unsafe and will result in runtime
     exceptions.
 </p>
 <p>
     Tasks are flexible and extremely useful for the encapsulation of "work". Because
     <a href="../../javafx/concurrent/Service.html" title="class in javafx.concurrent"><code>Service</code></a> is designed to execute a Task, any Tasks defined by the application
     or library code can easily be used with a Service. Likewise, since Task extends
     from FutureTask, it is very easy and natural to use a Task with the java concurrency
     <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Executor.html?is-external=true" title="class or interface in java.util.concurrent"><code>Executor</code></a> API. Since a Task is Runnable, you
     can also call it directly (by invoking the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/FutureTask.html?is-external=true#run--" title="class or interface in java.util.concurrent"><code>FutureTask.run()</code></a> method)
     from another background thread. This allows for composition of work, or pass it to
     a new Thread constructed and executed manually. Finally, since you can
     manually create a new Thread, passing it a Runnable, it is possible to use
     the following idiom:
     <pre><code>
         Thread th = new Thread(task);
         th.setDaemon(true);
         th.start();
     </code></pre>
     Note that this code sets the daemon flag of the Thread to true. If you
     want a background thread to prevent the VM from existing after the last
     stage is closed, then you would want daemon to be false. However, if
     you want the background threads to simply terminate after all the
     stages are closed, then you must set daemon to true.
 </p>
 <p>
     Although <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ExecutorService.html?is-external=true" title="class or interface in java.util.concurrent"><code>ExecutorService</code></a> defines several methods which
     take a Runnable, you should generally limit yourself to using the <code>execute</code>
     method inherited from <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Executor.html?is-external=true" title="class or interface in java.util.concurrent"><code>Executor</code></a>.
 </p>
 <p>
     As with FutureTask, a Task is a one-shot class and cannot be reused. See <a href="../../javafx/concurrent/Service.html" title="class in javafx.concurrent"><code>Service</code></a>
     for a reusable <a href="../../javafx/concurrent/Worker.html" title="interface in javafx.concurrent"><code>Worker</code></a>.
 </p>
 <p>
     Because the Task is designed for use with JavaFX GUI applications, it ensures
     that every change to its public properties, as well as change notifications
     for state, errors, and for event handlers, all occur on the main JavaFX application
     thread. Accessing these properties from a background thread (including the
     <a href="../../javafx/concurrent/Task.html#call--"><code>call()</code></a> method) will result in runtime exceptions being raised. The only exception
     to this, is when initially configuring a Task, which may safely be done
     from any thread. However, once the Task has been initialized and
     started, it may only thereafter be used from the FX thread (except for those methods clearly
     marked as being appropriate for the subclass to invoke from the background thread).
 </p>
 <p>
     It is <strong>strongly encouraged</strong> that all Tasks be initialized with
     immutable state upon which the Task will operate. This should be done by providing
     a Task constructor which takes the parameters necessary for execution of the Task.
     Immutable state makes it easy and safe to use from any thread and ensures
     correctness in the presence of multiple threads.
 </p>
 <p>
     In Java there is no reliable way to "kill" a thread in process. However,
     when <code>cancel</code> is called on a Task, it is important that
     the Task stop processing. A "run-away" Task might continue processing
     and updating the message, text, and progress properties even after the
     Task has been cancelled! In Java, cancelling a Task is a cooperative
     endeavor. The user of the Task will request that it be cancelled, and
     the author of the Task must check whether is has been cancelled within
     the body of the <code>call</code> method. There are two ways this can
     be done. First, the Task author may check the isCancelled method,
     inherited from <code>FutureTask</code>, to see whether the Task has
     been cancelled. Second, if the Task implementation makes use of any
     blocking calls (such as NIO InterruptibleChannels or Thread.sleep) and
     the task is cancelled while in such a blocking call, an
     InterruptedException is thrown. Task implementations which have blocking
     calls should recognize that an interrupted thread may be the signal for
     a cancelled task and should double check the isCancelled method to ensure
     that the InterruptedException was thrown due to the cancellation of the
     Task.
 </p>
 <h2>Examples</h2>
 <p>
     The following set of examples demonstrate some of the most common uses of
     Tasks.
 </p>

 <h3>A Simple Loop</h3>

 <p>
     The first example is a simple loop that does nothing particularly useful,
     but demonstrates the fundamental aspects of writing a Task correctly. This
     example will simply loop and print to standard out on each loop iteration.
     When it completes, it returns the number of times it iterated.
 </p>

 <pre><code>
     Task&lt;Integer&gt; task = new Task&lt;Integer&gt;() {
         &#64;Override protected Integer call() throws Exception {
             int iterations;
             for (iterations = 0; iterations &lt; 100000; iterations++) {
                 if (isCancelled()) {
                     break;
                 }
                 System.out.println("Iteration " + iterations);
             }
             return iterations;
         }
     };
 </code></pre>

 <p>
     First, we define what type of value is returned from this Task. In this
     case, we want to return the number of times we iterated, so we will
     specify the Task to be of type Integer by using generics. Then, within
     the implementation of the <code>call</code> method, we iterate from
     0 to 100000. On each iteration, we check to see whether this Task has
     been cancelled. If it has been, then we break out of the loop and return
     the number of times we iterated. Otherwise a message is printed to
     the console and the iteration count increased and we continue looping.
 </p>

 <p>
     Checking for isCancelled() in the loop body is critical, otherwise the
     developer may cancel the task, but the task will continue running
     and updating both the progress and returning the incorrect result
     from the end of the <code>call</code> method. A correct implementation
     of a Task will always check for cancellation.
 </p>

 <h3>A Simple Loop With Progress Notification</h3>

 <p>
     Similar to the previous example, except this time we will modify the
     progress of the Task in each iteration. Note that we have a choice
     to make in the case of cancellation. Do we want to set the progress back
     to -1 (indeterminate) when the Task is cancelled, or do we want to leave
     the progress where it was at? In this case, let's leave the progress alone
     and only update the message on cancellation, though updating the
     progress after cancellation is a perfectly valid choice.
 </p>

 <pre><code>
     Task&lt;Integer&gt; task = new Task&lt;Integer&gt;() {
         &#64;Override protected Integer call() throws Exception {
             int iterations;
             for (iterations = 0; iterations &lt; 10000000; iterations++) {
                 if (isCancelled()) {
                     updateMessage("Cancelled");
                     break;
                 }
                 updateMessage("Iteration " + iterations);
                 updateProgress(iterations, 10000000);
             }
             return iterations;
         }
     };
 </code></pre>

 <p>
     As before, within the for loop we check whether the Task has been
     cancelled. If it has been cancelled, we will update the Task's
     message to indicate that it has been cancelled, and then break as
     before. If the Task has not been cancelled, then we will update its
     message to indicate the current iteration and then update the
     progress to indicate the current progress.
 </p>

 <h3>A Simple Loop With Progress Notification And Blocking Calls</h3>

 <p>
     This example adds to the previous examples a blocking call. Because a
     blocking call may thrown an InterruptedException, and because an
     InterruptedException may occur as a result of the Task being cancelled,
     we need to be sure to handle the InterruptedException and check on the
     cancel state.
 </p>

 <pre><code>
     Task&lt;Integer&gt; task = new Task&lt;Integer&gt;() {
         &#64;Override protected Integer call() throws Exception {
             int iterations;
             for (iterations = 0; iterations &lt; 1000; iterations++) {
                 if (isCancelled()) {
                     updateMessage("Cancelled");
                     break;
                 }
                 updateMessage("Iteration " + iterations);
                 updateProgress(iterations, 1000);

                 // Now block the thread for a short time, but be sure
                 // to check the interrupted exception for cancellation!
                 try {
                     Thread.sleep(100);
                 } catch (InterruptedException interrupted) {
                     if (isCancelled()) {
                         updateMessage("Cancelled");
                         break;
                     }
                 }
             }
             return iterations;
         }
     };
 </code></pre>

 <p>
     Here we have added to the body of the loop a <code>Thread.sleep</code>
     call. Since this is a blocking call, I have to handle the potential
     InterruptedException. Within the catch block, I will check whether
     the Task has been cancelled, and if so, update the message accordingly
     and break out of the loop.
 </p>

 <h3>A Task Which Takes Parameters</h3>

 <p>
     Most Tasks require some parameters in order to do useful work. For
     example, a DeleteRecordTask needs the object or primary key to delete
     from the database. A ReadFileTask needs the URI of the file to be read.
     Because Tasks operate on a background thread, care must be taken to
     make sure the body of the <code>call</code> method does not read or
     modify any shared state. There are two techniques most useful for
     doing this: using final variables, and passing variables to a Task
     during construction.
 </p>

 <p>
     When using a Task as an anonymous class, the most natural way to pass
     parameters to the Task is by using final variables. In this example,
     we pass to the Task the total number of times the Task should iterate.
 </p>

 <pre><code>
     final int totalIterations = 9000000;
     Task&lt;Integer&gt; task = new Task&lt;Integer&gt;() {
         &#64;Override protected Integer call() throws Exception {
             int iterations;
             for (iterations = 0; iterations &lt; totalIterations; iterations++) {
                 if (isCancelled()) {
                     updateMessage("Cancelled");
                     break;
                 }
                 updateMessage("Iteration " + iterations);
                 updateProgress(iterations, totalIterations);
             }
             return iterations;
         }
     };
 </code></pre>

 <p>
     Since <code>totalIterations</code> is final, the <code>call</code>
     method can safely read it and refer to it from a background thread.
 </p>

 <p>
     When writing Task libraries (as opposed to specific-use implementations),
     we need to use a different technique. In this case, I will create an
     IteratingTask which performs the same work as above. This time, since
     the IteratingTask is defined in its own file, it will need to have
     parameters passed to it in its constructor. These parameters are
     assigned to final variables.
 </p>

 <pre><code>
     public class IteratingTask extends Task&lt;Integer&gt; {
         private final int totalIterations;

         public IteratingTask(int totalIterations) {
             this.totalIterations = totalIterations;
         }

         &#64;Override protected Integer call() throws Exception {
             int iterations = 0;
             for (iterations = 0; iterations &lt; totalIterations; iterations++) {
                 if (isCancelled()) {
                     updateMessage("Cancelled");
                     break;
                 }
                 updateMessage("Iteration " + iterations);
                 updateProgress(iterations, totalIterations);
             }
             return iterations;
         }
     }
 </code></pre>

 <p>And then when used:</p>

 <pre><code>
     IteratingTask task = new IteratingTask(8000000);
 </code></pre>

 <p>In this way, parameters are passed to the IteratingTask in a safe
 manner, and again, are final. Thus, the <code>call</code> method can
 safely read this state from a background thread.</p>

 <p>WARNING: Do not pass mutable state to a Task and then operate on it
 from a background thread. Doing so may introduce race conditions. In
 particular, suppose you had a SaveCustomerTask which took a Customer
 in its constructor. Although the SaveCustomerTask may have a final
 reference to the Customer, if the Customer object is mutable, then it
 is possible that both the SaveCustomerTask and some other application code
 will be reading or modifying the state of the Customer from different
 threads. Be very careful in such cases, that while a mutable object such
 as this Customer is being used from a background thread, that it is
 not being used also from another thread. In particular, if the background
 thread is reading data from the database and updating the Customer object,
 and the Customer object is bound to scene graph nodes (such as UI
 controls), then there could be a violation of threading rules! For such
 cases, modify the Customer object from the FX Application Thread rather
 than from the background thread.</p>

 <pre><code>
     public class UpdateCustomerTask extends Task&lt;Customer&gt; {
         private final Customer customer;

         public UpdateCustomerTask(Customer customer) {
             this.customer = customer;
         }

         &#64;Override protected Customer call() throws Exception {
             // pseudo-code:
             //   query the database
             //   read the values

             // Now update the customer

                 }

 <h3>A Task Which Returns No Value</h3>

 <p>
     Many, if not most, Tasks should return a value upon completion. For
     CRUD Tasks, one would expect that a "Create" Task would return the newly
     created object or primary key, a "Read" Task would return the read
     object, an "Update" task would return the number of records updated,
     and a "Delete" task would return the number of records deleted.
 </p>

 <p>
     However sometimes there just isn't anything truly useful to return.
     For example, I might have a Task which writes to a file. Task has built
     into it a mechanism for indicating whether it has succeeded or failed
     along with the number of bytes written (the progress), and thus there is
     nothing really for me to return. In such a case, you can use the Void
     type. This is a special type in the Java language which can only be
     assigned the value of <code>null</code>. You would use it as follows:
 </p>

 <pre><code>
     final String filePath = "/foo.txt";
     final String contents = "Some contents";
     Task&lt;Void&gt; task = new Task&lt;Void&gt;() {
         &#64;Override protected Void call() throws Exception {
             File file = new File(filePath);
             FileOutputStream out = new FileOutputStream(file);
             // ... and other code to write the contents ...

             // Return null at the end of a Task of type Void
             return null;
         }
     };
 </code></pre>

 <h3>A Task Which Returns An ObservableList</h3>

 <p>Because the ListView, TableView, and other UI controls and scene graph
 nodes make use of ObservableList, it is common to want to create and return
 an ObservableList from a Task. When you do not care to display intermediate
 values, the easiest way to correctly write such a Task is simply to
 construct an ObservableList within the <code>call</code> method, and then
 return it at the conclusion of the Task.</p>

 <pre><code>
     Task&lt;ObservableList&lt;Rectangle&gt;&gt; task = new Task&lt;ObservableList&lt;Rectangle&gt;&gt;() {
         &#64;Override protected ObservableList&lt;Rectangle&gt; call() throws Exception {
             updateMessage("Creating Rectangles");
             ObservableList&lt;Rectangle&gt; results = FXCollections.observableArrayList();
             for (int i=0; i<100; i++) {
                 if (isCancelled()) break;
                 Rectangle r = new Rectangle(10, 10);
                 r.setX(10 * i);
                 results.add(r);
                 updateProgress(i, 100);
             }
             return results;
         }
     };
 </code></pre>

 <p>In the above example, we are going to create 100 rectangles and return
 them from this task. An ObservableList is created within the
 <code>call</code> method, populated, and then returned.</p>

 <h3>A Task Which Returns Partial Results</h3>

 <p>Sometimes you want to create a Task which will return partial results.
 Perhaps you are building a complex scene graph and want to show the
 scene graph as it is being constructed. Or perhaps you are reading a large
 amount of data over the network and want to display the entries in a
 TableView as the data is arriving. In such cases, there is some shared state
 available both to the FX Application Thread and the background thread.
 Great care must be taken to <strong>never update shared state from any
 thread other than the FX Application Thread</strong>.</p>

 <p>The easiest way to do this is to take advantage of the <a href="../../javafx/concurrent/Task.html#updateValue-V-"><code>updateValue(Object)</code></a> method.
 This method may be called repeatedly from the background thread. Updates are coalesced to
 prevent saturation of the FX event queue. This means you can call it as frequently as
 you like from the background thread but only the most recent set is ultimately set.</p>

 <pre><code>
     Task&lt;Long&gt; task = new Task&lt;Long&gt;() {
         &#64;Override protected Long call() throws Exception {
             long a=0;
             long b=1;
             for (long i = 0; i &lt; Long.MAX_VALUE; i++){
                 updateValue(a);
                 a += b;
                 b = a - b;
             }
             return a;
         }
     };
 </code></pre>

 <p>Another way to do this is to expose a new property on the Task
 which will represent the partial result. Then make sure to use
 <code>Platform.runLater</code> when updating the partial result.</p>

 <pre><code>
     Task&lt;Long&gt; task = new Task&lt;Long&gt;() {
         &#64;Override protected Long call() throws Exception {
             long a=0;
             long b=1;
             for (long i = 0; i &lt; Long.MAX_VALUE; i++){
                 final long v = a;
                 Platform.runLater(new Runnable() {
                     &#64;Override public void run() {
                         updateValue(v);
                     }
                 }
                 a += b;
                 b = a - b;
             }
             return a;
         }
     };
 </code></pre>

 <p>Suppose instead of updating a single value, you want to populate an ObservableList
 with results as they are obtained. One approach is to expose a new property on the Task
 which will represent the partial result. Then make sure to use
 <code>Platform.runLater</code> when adding new items to the partial
 result.</p>

 <pre><code>
     public class PartialResultsTask extends Task&lt;ObservableList&lt;Rectangle&gt;&gt; {
         // Uses Java 7 diamond operator
         private ReadOnlyObjectWrapper<ObservableList<Rectangle>> partialResults =
                 new ReadOnlyObjectWrapper<>(this, "partialResults",
                         FXCollections.observableArrayList(new ArrayList<Rectangle>()));

         public final ObservableList<Rectangle> getPartialResults() { return partialResults.get(); }
         public final ReadOnlyObjectProperty<ObservableList<Rectangle>> partialResultsProperty() {
             return partialResults.getReadOnlyProperty();
         }

         &#64;Override protected ObservableList<Rectangle> call() throws Exception {
             updateMessage("Creating Rectangles...");
             for (int i=0; i<100; i++) {
                 if (isCancelled()) break;
                 final Rectangle r = new Rectangle(10, 10);
                 r.setX(10 * i);
                 Platform.runLater(new Runnable() {
                     &#64;Override public void run() {
                         partialResults.get().add(r);
                     }
                 });
                 updateProgress(i, 100);
             }
             return partialResults.get();
         }
     }
 </code></pre>

 <h3>A Task Which Modifies The Scene Graph</h3>

 <p>Generally, Tasks should not interact directly with the UI. Doing so
 creates a tight coupling between a specific Task implementation and a
 specific part of your UI. However, when you do want to create such a
 coupling, you must ensure that you use <code>Platform.runLater</code>
 so that any modifications of the scene graph occur on the
 FX Application Thread.</p>

 <pre><code>
     final Group group = new Group();
     Task&lt;Void&gt; task = new Task&lt;Void&gt;() {
         &#64;Override protected Void call() throws Exception {
             for (int i=0; i<100; i++) {
                 if (isCancelled()) break;
                 final Rectangle r = new Rectangle(10, 10);
                 r.setX(10 * i);
                 Platform.runLater(new Runnable() {
                     &#64;Override public void run() {
                         group.getChildren().add(r);
                     }
                 });
             }
             return null;
         }
     };
 </code></pre>

 <h3>Reacting To State Changes Generically</h3>

 <p>Sometimes you may want to write a Task which updates its progress,
 message, text, or in some other way reacts whenever a state change
 happens on the Task. For example, you may want to change the status
 message on the Task on Failure, Success, Running, or Cancelled state changes.
 </p>
 <pre><code>
     Task&lt;Integer&gt; task = new Task&lt;Integer&gt;() {
         &#64;Override protected Integer call() throws Exception {
             int iterations = 0;
             for (iterations = 0; iterations &lt; 100000; iterations++) {
                 if (isCancelled()) {
                     break;
                 }
                 System.out.println("Iteration " + iterations);
             }
             return iterations;
         }

         &#64;Override protected void succeeded() {
             super.succeeded();
             updateMessage("Done!");
         }

         &#64;Override protected void cancelled() {
             super.cancelled();
             updateMessage("Cancelled!");
         }

         &#64;Override protected void failed() {
             super.failed();
             updateMessage("Failed!");
         }
     };
